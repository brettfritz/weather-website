# Weather Dashboard Website

## Purpose

I built this blog website in order to showcase my skills as a web developer, and to provide a place for myself and page visitors to gather weather information for any city in the world.

## Description and Usage

Upon loading the page, the user is greeted with a search bar for them to input any city in the world to gather weather information for. When the user searches, a fetch is made to the openweathermap.org server api to gather the information. This information is then returned in a main display for the current weather of that location. In addition, a 5 day forecast is also provided for that location underneath. The website also stores all searches in the local storage and displays the history under the search bar. The user can then quickly and easily click on any of the recent search buttons at any time to get the weather information for that city.
